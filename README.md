#### Prerequisites
To run the Postman collection and interact with the GitHub API, you will need:

Postman installed (latest version).
A GitHub account.
A GitHub Personal Access Token with the appropriate permissions (to interact with repositories and issues).

#### Environment Setup

    {{host}}: API base URL, typically set to https://api.github.com.
    {{user}}: Your GitHub username.
    {{repo}}: The name of the GitHub repository where you want to create/manage issues.
2. **Authorization**: In Postman, use the **Bearer Token** for authorization.
Set the token value as your GitHub Personal Access Token (with necessary permissions).

**#### Project Structure**
Hereâ€™s a summary of the main API calls in the collection:

GitHub Labels:

GET: Fetch labels for an issue from a specific repository.
GitHub Issues:

GET: Fetch details of an existing issue.
POST: Create a new issue in a GitHub repository.
